# Remarks

The delima with this solution is that the Airtable API does not provide for periodic full exports of an entire data table "base" to a CSV. Sure, you can manually login to Airtable and download a CSV, but they do not allow automating the process.

GeoCSV

This javascript reads data from the .csv file and then it gets formatted and displayed on the client side.
